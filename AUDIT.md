# Recipe Vault Codebase Audit

## Overview

This document outlines the findings from a comprehensive audit of the Recipe Vault codebase, including identified issues, security concerns, and recommendations for improvement. Note: The Flask backend architecture is maintained as is due to Vercel deployment requirements.

## 1. Architecture and Project Structure

   - Configuration files scattered across the project
   - Inconsistent file naming conventions

2. **Code Organization**
   - Mixed concerns in some components
   - Inconsistent component structure
   - Lack of clear separation between UI and business logic

### Recommendations

1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**

   - Consolidate type definitions into `src/types/`
   - Create clear documentation for project structure
   - Standardize configuration file locations
   - Implement consistent file naming conventions

2. **Medium-term (1-2 months)**

   - Create clear component documentation
   - Implement proper separation of concerns
   - Standardize component structure
   - Create clear API documentation

3. **Long-term (3-6 months)**
   - Create comprehensive architecture documentation
   - Implement proper code organization standards
   - Create component library documentation
   - Implement proper testing standards

## 2. API Implementation

   -- Enable RLS
   ALTER TABLE recipe_vault_recipes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Create policy
   CREATE POLICY user_recipes_policy ON recipe_vault_recipes
   USING (userId = current_user);
   ```

2. **Audit Logging**

   ```typescript
   // utils/auditLogger.ts
   export const auditLogger = {
     log: async (
       userId: string,
       action: string,
       details: Record<string, unknown>,
     ) => {
       await db.insert(auditLogs).values({

   export const checkBruteForce = (userId: string): boolean => {
     const attempts = failedAttempts.get(userId);
     if (!attempts) return false;

     if (
       attempts.count >= 5 &&
       Date.now() - attempts.lastAttempt.getTime() < 15 * 60 * 1000
